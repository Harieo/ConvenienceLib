# ConvenienceLib
![Java CI](https://github.com/Harieo/ConvenienceLib/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)

A library of code and APIs to make Spigot coding less of a hassle.  
At the time of writing, this library was created in **Spigot v1.12.2** because 
this is the most compatible version currently available.  

The library is an implementation of the Spigot API with changes that
make it easier to use, such as 
[scoreboard](https://github.com/Harieo/ConvenienceLib/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/co/harieo/ConvenienceLib/scoreboards)
and [tab-list](https://github.com/Harieo/ConvenienceLib/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/co/harieo/ConvenienceLib/scoreboards/tablist)
handling APIs.
